Trang Nguyen is currently a second-year M.S./PhD student working in the InfoFusion Lab advised by Professor Madalina Fiterau. Her main drive in research is to observe patterns in challenges across multiple domains and translate them into a smaller set of data problems to solve. Her current problem of interest is how to design **interpretable** multimodal learning systems that can **assist** human in processing data of various formats, frequency, and quality. You can check out her [Three Minute Thesis Finalist video](https://rb.gy/su2um) to learn more about one of the applications in multimodal learning that she is passionate about.

Prior to UMass, Trang has worked for several years as a data scientist and data engineer both in non-profit and private sectors and both in big structured organizations and small start-ups. This experience allows her to interact with multiple groups of users so research adoption and research outreach are two goals she commits to. 

Besides research, Trang serves as Co-Chair of [Voices of Data Science (VDS)](https://www.voices-of-data-science.com/), an annual data science conference hosted by UMass. Data science has grown to be one of the most popular careers in the last five years. Through VDS, she hopes to highlight voices of not only data scientists from underrepresented communities but also the ones that do data science in less conventional areas. Her ambition is to show the younger generations of data scientists, especially international students who have a big time constraint of choosing a career path, that there are more paths within data science with equal opportunities and risks than the ones often marketed at school.
